# Portfolio

This is my first personal portfolio for the year 2022. 
You will be able to see few of my projects and different links to contact me.

This is still a project under development and few pages need to be done.

- About me: a page with my personal description.
- Projects: a page of each project explaining the concept and purpose.

This project was prototype in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/CzGQfZCsf1hX7TZmbZjEw2/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1),
and then converted to React.

This is still a project under development and is regularly updated.
